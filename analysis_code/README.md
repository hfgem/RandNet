# Analysis Code
 This folder contains code written to analyze RandNet data. Each file focuses on a particular aspect of analyses.
 
 ## analyses_no_inhibitory.m
 This program contains analyses of sequences that exclude inhibitory neurons.
 
 ## analyses_sequences.m
 This program contains analyses of sequences ranging from the number of participating neurons to the similarity between different initializations.
 
 ## cluster_analyses.m
 This program analyses the order in which network clusters are represented in the firing.
 
 ## compare_outputs.m
 This program compares sequences of firing from neuron initializations and current initializations.
 
 ## net_struct_analyses.m
 This program visualizes the network structure and analyzes its basic properties.
 
 ## physics_sequences.m
 This program analyzes the structure of a sequence, primarily separating out the sequence prior to avalanche.
 
 ## viualize_cluster_sequences.m
 This program visualizes a sequences of clusters a spike sequences progresses through, based on outputs from lif_network_postrotation.m
 
 ## visualize_voltage_traces.m
 This program visualizes how a spike in one neuron affects connected neurons by looking at membrane potential deflections.
